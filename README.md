## Analyzing the financial records of a company


I was asked to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following;


The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

(Total/(Number of months - 1))

The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.




My motivation was to make a code that made it easy for a company to see their financial records.
It allowed easy access to financial records just by accessing the console on the browser.



## Usage

Open the Console to See the Magic, you will then see the javascript code at work.

## Tests

I tested results using Excel (sum and average) to make sure the amount I was getting is correct.
